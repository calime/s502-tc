The `0x100` allows it to take a maximum of `0x100` bytes. `. 0x0f00 smth` If the `smth` section is larger than `0x100` bytes then `text` will overwrite it after address `0x1000`. You can set a size limit as in the `data` section if you want to prevent that. `one two 0x500` Here the sections `one` and `two` combined are allowed `0x500` bytes."]]});
