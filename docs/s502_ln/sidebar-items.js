If no start address is give at the beginning of the script then the default is 0. `text data 0x100 ` Here the  `data` section immediately follows text. The `0x100` allows the section to be a maximum of `0x100` bytes. `text one two 0x200 ` Here the sections `one` and `two` combined are allowed `0x200` bytes. `two` immediately follows `one`. `text 0x0f00 something ` If the `something` section is larger than `0x100` bytes then it will overwrite the beginning of `text` because it is listed later in the script. You can set a size limit as in the `data` section if you want to prevent that. Because it is at the earliest address, it will be at offset 0 in the output binary file."]]});
